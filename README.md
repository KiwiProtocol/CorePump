# CorePump
Core Pump Bot is an innovative memecoin launchpad bot on Telegram, designed to simplify and streamline the process of launching memecoins on the Core Chain. Tokens are tradeable without inital liquidity, when market cap reaches $69k, liquidity is instantly deployed on LFGswap, and burned. It includes a Wallet manager, Token factory, and Launchpad.

## Innovation

The primary innovation of CorePumpBot lies in its unique approach to memecoin launches:

- **Instant Tradability**: Tokens are tradeable immediately upon launch, without the need for initial liquidity.
- **Automatic Liquidity Deployment**: When a memecoin's market cap reaches $69,000, liquidity is automatically deployed on LFGswap (a Core Chain DEX).
- **Liquidity Burning**: After deployment, the liquidity is burned, creating a more stable trading environment.
- **Telegram Integration**: The entire process of creating, launching, and trading memecoins is managed through a Telegram bot, making it highly accessible.
- **Core Chain Focus**: By focusing on Core Chain, the bot taps into a growing ecosystem with fast transactions and low fees.

## Core Chain Integration

Core Chain is integrated into every aspect of CorePumpBot:

1. **Wallet Creation**: Wallets are created and managed on Core Chain.
2. **Token Creation**: The Token Factory deploys new tokens directly to Core Chain.
3. **Trading**: All trading activities occur on Core Chain.
4. **Liquidity Deployment**: When triggered, liquidity is deployed to LFGswap on Core Chain.

## Backend Architecture

The backend of CorePumpBot is built with Node.js and uses several key components:

- **Telegram Bot API**: Handled through the Telegraf library to manage user interactions.
- **MongoDB**: Stores user data, wallet information, and token details.
- **Ethers.js**: Interacts with the Core Chain for wallet operations and smart contract interactions.
- **Smart Contracts**: Custom contracts for token creation and trading logic.
- **Cloudinary**: For image processing and storage.

Key backend processes include:

- Wallet creation and management
- Token deployment
- Trading logic
- Automatic liquidity deployment
- Database management for user data and token information

## User Interface (UI)

The UI is entirely within Telegram, utilizing the bot's messaging capabilities:

1. **Main Menu**: Accessed via the /start command, offering options for Wallets Manager, Launchpad, and Token Factory.
2. **Wallets Manager**: Create Wallet, Import Wallet, Deposit, Withdraw
3. **Token Factory**: Guides users through token creation with prompts for name, symbol, supply, etc.
4. **Launchpad**: 
   - Launch Memecoin: Guides users through the memecoin launch process.
   - Trade Memecoins: Displays available memecoins with trading options.
5. **Trading Interface**: For each memecoin, displays:
   - Token info (name, symbol, supply, market cap, volume)
   - Buy and Sell buttons
   - Website and Social links
   - View Chart option

## Workflow

1. User starts the bot and creates or imports a wallet.
2. User can create a new token using the Token Factory.
3. To launch a memecoin, user provides token details and launches via the Launchpad.
4. The memecoin becomes instantly tradeable.
5. Other users can view and trade the memecoin.
6. When market cap reaches $69k, liquidity is automatically deployed and burned.

## Security Considerations

- Private keys are encrypted before storage.
- Users are advised to store private keys securely and delete sensitive messages.
- The bot doesn't store or have access to user funds directly.

## Future Developments

Potential areas for future enhancement include:

1. Integration with more DEXes on Core Chain.
2. Advanced trading features like limit orders.
3. Portfolio tracking and analytics.
4. Multi-chain support for cross-chain memecoin launches.

## Conclusion

CorePumpBot represents a novel approach to memecoin launches and trading, leveraging the strengths of Core Chain and the accessibility of Telegram. By automating key processes and providing a user-friendly interface, it lowers the barrier to entry for memecoin creation and trading, potentially driving increased activity in the Core Chain ecosystem.
